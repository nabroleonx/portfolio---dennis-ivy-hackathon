                I am a software developer based in Ethiopia. I am currently
                enrolled as a fourth year Software Engineering student Bahir Dar
                Institute of Technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was born and raised in a rural area. However, I have always
                been fascinated with technology. I love maths and physics. When
                I was a kid, I was always tinkering with broken radios and other
                gadgets in our house. My family used to say I am going to be an
                engineer one day. I believe that played a large role to where I
                am now. I didnâ€™t have a phone let alone a computer for almost my
                entire adulthood. Despite all of that, my curiousty was fueling
                my passion for technology day after day.
              </p>
              <p>
                I remember the first time I touched a computer. A guy who used
                to live in our compound was learning his MSc and his brother
                sent him a PC for his thesis. I used to sit with him and watch
                how it all works. I was a quick learner and quite an
                experimenter so I end up helping him navigate things.
              </p>
              <p>
                One day I was watching a show called &quote;Tech-Talk with
                Solomon&quote; and lucky for me the guest was Prof. Jelani
                Nelson. I remember him explaning binary seach algorithms using
                the famous phone book analogy, and then I was hooked. It was
                like a revelation for me. I was in grade 9 then. From that day
                on, I took his pc when he was not using it and started teaching
                myself some HTML. The rest is history. I went on to learn
                different programming languages Python, JavaScript, Java, C++
                etc and different frameworks and libraries(Reactjs/Nextjs,
                Django, etc).
